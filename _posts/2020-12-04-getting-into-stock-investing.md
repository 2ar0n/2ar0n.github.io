Disclaimer I take no responsibility about the correctness or accuracy of any of the words and information presented here, I take this merely of a track of my progress. Citing another blogger: `Because I have no need of rigor to post on the internet, (or even a need to be correct) Iâ€™m going to post some of those intuitions here as I understand them.`.

## Getting started

Having actively worked for a few years now, I've put enough money aside to start making meaningful investments. Remember that liquid money always suffers from value depreciation through inflation. Real estate would probably have been my prefered choice but it is not easily compatible with my current situation. Given that in Europe government bonds currently have a negative yield, the stock market is the safest best at the moment. Now, I don't have the desire nor time to select, track and trade stocks myself and lean towards long term investment rather than daily adjustments or optimization of a portfolio, so I chose to favor Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Here's some [information](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-mutual-fund-difference.asp) about ETFs as compared to mutual funds.

Before getting more into detail of my quest, I will list some ressources that help me on the way:

- [mypersonalfinance.ch](https://www.mypersonalfinance.ch/): must-read blog that provides easy to read insights. Some stuff is Swizterland-related but the most investment information is still relevant
- [Blogheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/EU_investing): the boglehead wiki, here the page specific for investors in Europe
- [r/eupersonalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/): subreddit dedicated to personal investments for Europeans
- [JustETF](https://www.justetf.com): ETF search tool, useful without a premium account

Once the basic ideas are understood, check out different stock brokers, comparing the commission costs (I went with [Degiro](https://www.degiro.com/)). I won't talk about how to proceed after as the previous ressources should be sufficient to help out from here on, but I want to underline that you should check the difference between *distributing and accumulating* ETFs and which to choose based on your fiscal residence.

## Finding sustainable investments

Investing money and making it grow is one thing, but - at least for myself - it mattered just as much that my money was used to support sustainable companies and the transition to renewable energy. Since I am thankfully not alone in this sight, recently many ESG (for **e**nvironmental, **s**ocial and **g**overnance) ETFs apperead and prospered. For instance, one of the big index providers MSCI started listing different [ESG ETFs](https://www.msci.com/esg-indexes). Some indicies are also designed to [align with the Paris Agreements](https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/aligning-with-the-paris/02152782499). JustETF also has [a page](https://www.justetf.com/en/how-to/invest-in-social-responsibility-europe.html) to find some of these.

Sounds good, right? It does until you start digging a bit deeper [into the detail](https://www.ipe.com/reports/etfs-for-esg-the-devil-in-the-detail-of-low-carbon-etfs/10033631.article) or look into the actual companies included into those indicies, which paint a different picture. I haven't found an ideal solution yet, but will stay on the lookout for new clean and sustainable investment opportunities.
