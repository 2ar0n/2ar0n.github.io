# 2ar0n.github.io

Small static website to play around with HTML/CSS and Jekyll.

You can preview it locally using a container by running the `serve_in_container.bash` script, the website will then be accessible at the default `localhost:4000` location. The current script uses `podman` but you can swap the command for `docker`.
